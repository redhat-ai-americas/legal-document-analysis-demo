# Agentic Contract Analysis Approach

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to automated contract analysis using an agentic workflow powered by LangGraph and small language models. The system processes contract documents through a multi-stage pipeline that combines document classification, intelligent querying, and structured data extraction with **professional template integration**.

## Core Philosophy

### Small Model Efficiency
- **Focused Tasks**: Each LLM call handles a single, well-defined task (classify one sentence, answer one question)
- **Context Optimization**: Use only relevant classified sentences rather than full documents
- **Token Management**: Precise token counting with tiktoken to stay within small model limits (~4K tokens)
- **Quality over Quantity**: Multiple validation stages ensure accuracy despite smaller model capabilities

### Agentic Workflow Design
- **State-Driven**: Central state object flows through all processing nodes
- **Modular Nodes**: Each processing step is an independent, testable component
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures with retry mechanisms
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and state tracking throughout the pipeline

### Template Philosophy
- **Professional Output**: Generate compliant due diligence Excel templates
- **Y/N Extraction**: Intelligent conversion of natural language to binary determinations
- **Master Tracking**: Cross-document comparison with consolidated dashboards
- **Quality Assurance**: Dual-model validation for business-critical decisions

## Architecture

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline

```
PDF/MD Input → Document Loader → Entity Extractor → Target Classifier → Reference Classifier → Questionnaire Processor → Template Generator
```

#### Document Loader
- **Purpose**: Load and preprocess documents into analyzable sentences
- **Approach**: 
  - Converts PDFs to markdown using Docling for better text extraction
  - Splits documents into sentences using regex patterns
  - Filters out headers and formatting artifacts
  - Loads terminology definitions from YAML configuration

#### Entity Extractor
- **Purpose**: Extract structured entities (dates, parties, terms) for template population
- **Approach**:
  - Pattern-based extraction for deterministic fields
  - Date parsing and normalization
  - Party identification and relationship mapping
  - Key term identification for risk assessment

#### Target Classifier
- **Purpose**: Classify sentences from the target contract document
- **Approach**:
  - Two-stage classification: Initial classification + validation
  - Uses structured JSON output for consistent parsing
  - Maps sentences to legal terminology (Term, Indemnification, Liability, etc.)
  - Validates classifications against detailed term definitions

#### Reference Classifier
- **Purpose**: Classify sentences from the reference/template contract
- **Approach**:
  - Identical process to target classifier
  - Provides comparative context for questionnaire responses
  - Enables baseline comparison between documents

### 2. Template Integration

#### Professional Excel Output
- **Template Structure**: Matches due diligence review template format
- **Y/N Columns**: Source Code, Exclusivity, Pricing, IP Rights, Liability, Assignment
- **Details Columns**: Supporting context and explanations for each determination
- **Conditional Formatting**: Color-coded risk indicators (Green=Low, Red=High, Yellow=Review)

#### Intelligent Y/N Extraction
```python
def extract_y_n_and_details(response_text):
    """Convert natural language responses to Y/N determinations"""
    # Logic for interpreting LLM responses:
    # "Y" for confirmed presence of provisions
    # "N" for explicit absence or non-standard terms  
    # "Review" for unclear responses requiring manual verification
```

#### Master Comparison Features
- **Cross-Document Analysis**: Track patterns across multiple contracts
- **Risk Aggregation**: Portfolio-level risk assessment
- **Processing Metrics**: Quality scores and confidence ratings
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify common issues across contract sets

### 3. Dual Model Validation

#### Granite + Mixtral Integration
- **Primary Model**: Granite for consistent, structured responses
- **Validation Model**: Mixtral for cross-validation and quality scoring
- **Confidence Metrics**: Agreement scores between models
- **Quality Assessment**: Automated quality grading (A-F scale)

#### Model Comparison Strategy
```python
def compare_model_responses(granite_response, mixtral_response):
    """Compare responses from both models for quality assurance"""
    # Semantic similarity analysis
    # Confidence scoring based on agreement
    # Flag discrepancies for manual review
```

### 4. Intelligent Querying System

#### Questionnaire-Driven Analysis
- **Purpose**: Extract structured business intelligence from legal documents
- **Approach**:
  - 17 standardized questions covering key contract elements
  - Questions organized into logical sections (Document Info, Key Clauses, Risk Assessment)
  - Each question processed independently with relevant context

#### Template Mapping
```yaml
# Question to Template Column Mapping
contract_start_date: "Contract Start Date"
source_code_access: "Source Code Y/N + Details"
exclusivity_non_competes: "Exclusivity Y/N + Details"
forced_pricing_adjustments: "Pricing Y/N + Details"
ip_rights: "IP Y/N + Details"
limitation_of_liability: "Liability Y/N + Details"
assignment_coc: "Assignment Y/N + Details"
```

#### Context Selection Strategy
- **Smart Filtering**: Map questions to relevant terminology terms
- **Precise Context**: Include only classified sentences related to each question
- **Token Optimization**: Dynamic allocation of context (50% target, 50% reference)
- **Fallback Handling**: Use document headers for questions without specific terms

### 5. Output Generation

#### Multi-Format Outputs
1. **Template Excel** (`analysis_template.xlsx`)
   - Individual document analysis in format
   - Professional formatting with conditional highlighting
   - Y/N determinations with supporting details

2. **Master Comparison Excel** (`contract_analysis_template_master.xlsx`)

3. **Structured Analysis** (YAML, Markdown)

   - Human-friendly reports with citations
   - Processing metadata and quality scores
